        "\n",
        "1. **OpenAI's Agents SDK:** We explored the capabilities of OpenAI's Agents SDK, which provides a robust framework for creating and managing AI agents. The SDK's features, such as multi-agent management, task delegation, and customizable workflows, enable the development of sophisticated AI systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Creating and Integrating Agents:** We learned how to create simple agents with specific functionalities, such as the Math Agent with a calculator tool and the Web Searcher Agent with web search capabilities. These agents were integrated into a multi-agent framework, demonstrating the ease of setting up specialized agents to handle different tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Task Delegation and Handoffs:** A significant focus was placed on understanding the importance of task delegation and agent handoffs. The Primary Agent was designed to delegate tasks to sub-agents based on the nature of the request, ensuring efficient task management and execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Utilizing the Responses API:** The tutorial introduced the new Responses API, which replaces the Assistants API. The Responses API enhances the ability to build autonomous agents capable of performing complex tasks without direct human intervention. This transition is significant as it simplifies integration and future-proofs applications by providing continued support and access to the latest features.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Security and Error Handling:** We emphasized the importance of secure API key management using environment variables and implemented error handling to manage potential issues during agent operations."
